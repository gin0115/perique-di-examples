# perique-di-examples

A selection of examples of using the DI Container with the Perique Framework (https://github.com/Pink-Crab/Perqiue-Framework/)

To see how these work in action, 

* Clone this repo to you `wp-content/plugins` directory
* Then run `composer install --no-dev`

* Activate the plugin in `wp-admin`


## Cache Examples

These examples show how an Interface can be used with the Container. You can use fallback instances or define what dependency to use on a class by class basis. 

## Nested Examples

These examples show how dependencies can be nested and how you can swap out instances of dependencies and run custom initialisation with classes that use a fluent API.

> If you would like to see any other examples using the Container, please leave an issue with more details.
